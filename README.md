# NMEA 0183 Bandwidth Calculator (Console and GUI Version)

This is the original version of the NMEA 0183 Bandwidth Calculator which will be included in my larger NMEA 0183 Toolkit project. 

It was created with monolithic program files for each version. this project was to just get me started with the larger project which is organized by feature.

## Features

- Show detailed sentence information
- Calculate bandwidth usage for multiple sentences
- Support for different baud rates (4800, 38400)
- Support for various update rates (0.5Hz to 20Hz)
- Hlpe files appropriate for each verison.


*** NOTES ***

While I did attempt to create a fairly full and robust list of NMEA 0183 sentences in the json file, it is by no means a complete list of all that is out there.
The NMEA 0183 specifcaiton goes back to 1983 (inception, 1987 first official standard). There have been approx 8 updates since. 
The cost of purchasing the spec docs is astronomical so i did my best from what I could get off the Internet.
Having said that, the sentence details are accurate with the exception of the standards details. I had great ambition when starting but it was too labor intensive for me.
Edit the data as you see fit for your needs. My larger NMEA 0183 Toolkit project (as of yet unreleased) has a database editor built in to make changes easier.
You could add one yourself if you like or simply edit the json file as you see fit.

I have spent 39 years in the marine electroncis industry using NMEA 0183 a lot. I have built many tools for it and other purposes in the industry.
I will post more projects in the weeks/months to come and let everyone have at it.
